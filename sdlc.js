// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/


// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysis = "This is the second step, where team is gathering maximum information from the client about the product, analyze it. The main goal is for both sides to completely understand all product requirements."
const design = "In this step the developer decides the dest desigh approach, technology, languages that suits the software."
const implement = "In this step, developers are to built the entire system by writing code."
const testing = "The software is deployed to the testing environment where its funclionality is tested, followed by deployment (Beta)."
const maintain = "The product is in use and it has to be maintained, such as change of end user environment or technology, the software is updated timely."
